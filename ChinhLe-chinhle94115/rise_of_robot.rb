#part of homework is to have 3 "why" questions
#creat a class
#set_attributes & read/write capabilities
#build a constructor
#instantiate

require 'pry'
require 'pry-byebug'

class Robot    #ruby convention, class words are capitalized and never plural
  #name, model, origin


  #creates getter && setter methods for each attribute
  attr_accessor :name, :type, :origin  #creates two methods for each specified
# "attr_accessor" creates methods for the class
# so .new is a universal method that says we are creating something new, whereas
# we are creating new methods that exist for just this class (Robot)




  #this method creates new instances of the robot class
  #@instance_variables are available throughout the class.
  #@name is an instance variable

#create the constructor - a method that creates an instance of a class

    @type = type        # instance variables, can go to most methods in a class
    @origin = origin    #instance variables always start with @
  end
